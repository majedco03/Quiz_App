Quiz App

This is a simple quiz application developed as part of my Flutter and Dart learning journey, specifically after completing the Basics II section.

Overview

The app consists of three main screens:
	1.	Start Screen – A welcome page with a button to begin the quiz.
	2.	Quiz Screen – Displays one question at a time with four possible answers.
	3.	Result Screen – Shows a summary of all questions, the user’s chosen answers, and the correct answers.

Features
	•	Multiple-choice questions with four answer options.
	•	Color-coded result indicators for correct and incorrect answers.
	•	Clear and simple navigation between screens.

How It Works
	1.	The user starts the quiz from the Start Screen.
	2.	Each question is displayed with four answer options—selecting one moves to the next question.
	3.	After all questions are answered, the Result Screen displays the total score with the your answers and the correct answer for each question.
